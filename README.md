COLIB
=====

COLIB is a Python library for accessing and altering annotated DNA sequences. It keeps track of components and lifts
over feature annotations when a component is "mutated" by applying a series of mutations. With `colib` you can
build new consensus sequences for cloned organisms and follow changes to feature annotations within a lineage.
